# Homonym Tracker

## Overview
Create an app that can access the Treit homonym list on iPhones.

## Problem
Treits like to discover homonyms but it's hard to keep track of them all across family members. We need a central repository for discovered homonyms.

## Goals
The app should work on iPhones and store data in a central repository so all Treits can access the current list of homonyms. The base list will be imported from Mom's 75th birthday yellow pad.

## Non-Goals
Commercialization, or expansion beyond a simple tracking app.

## Milestones
June 1 - Propose language and tools that will be used to create the app.
June 10th - App can read centralized list
June 30th - App can write to centralized list.
July 15th - Beta version installed on Treit phones.
August 1 - v 1.0 tested and shipped

## Proposed Solution
V 1.0 Create an app that will read the stored  homonym list and can display an alphabetical list of all discovered homonyms. 

V 1.1 add search feature

## Test Cases
Give to Treits
Fix probelems they find.
